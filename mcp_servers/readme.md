# First sample MCP Server

### Create an Open weather API key
1. Login and verify your email
2. Then head to subscriptions and subscribe to their plan. It's free for first few calls. So no amount charged.
3. Add it in the code in index.ts for API

Need to have latest Node version downloaded.

Install modules 

```sh
npm i
```

```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y tsx index.ts
```

This will open the browser window, 
1. select `connect`
2. select `list tools`
3. select `get-weather`
4. On the right side, enter the city you wish to check weather and click `Run Tool`.
