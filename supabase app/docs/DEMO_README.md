# My Demo App

This is a small Next.js demo app used to showcase simple styles, navigation, and a minimal Supabase auth flow example.

Quick start:

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Files to look at:
- `app/page.tsx` — home page and navigation
- `app/login/page.tsx` — demo login form
- `app/private/page.tsx` — protected page with logout

Remove or modify demo styles in `app/globals.css` as needed.
