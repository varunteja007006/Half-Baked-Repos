Do run the python_dummy_import file to get more information on this.

When you directly run this file in python it checks if it is main and executes accordingly (#code block 1).

When this file is imported by another file then it is indirectly run by that file hence it wont run the main but 
anything other than that
(#code block 2)

(#code block 3) is always run because it is not restricted by any condition.
